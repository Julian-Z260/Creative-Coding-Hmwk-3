How I got here.

The challenges I had to overcome when I was younger were many.  I grew up in poverty, I was bullied, and I had to fight for a lot when I was younger.  People thought I was never going to be anything, and I showed them who I was.  Even now I am still proving myself to my peers however I have found great pride and joy from what I had to overcome in the past.  I am here because of my own experiences and I have grown significantly.
